## GETTING STARTED

1. Checking Python version.
    - To be able to use this script you'll need to have Python installed, you can check whether you have it installed or not by typing in terminal:  
`python3 --version`  
or:  
`python --version` 
    - This script was written using version 3.9.0 and it is advised to use the same version.
    - If you don't have Python installed you can go to [Python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/) to download it.
    
 2. Creating Virtual Environment 
    - To create a virtual environment, decide upon a directory where you want to place it, and run the venv module as a script with the directory path:  
    `python3 -m venv your-env`  
    - Once youâ€™ve created a virtual environment, you may activate it.  
    `source your-env/bin/activate`
    
 3. Download
     - You need to clone repository to your local destination  
    `cd path/to/your/workspace`  
    `git clone https://github.com/robert-adamczyk/Collection`
    
 4. Requirements
    - Once your virtual environment is activated and project is cloned you need to install requirements:  
    `pip install -r requirements.txt`
    
 5. Make your secret key in settings.py     
   ```js
   In settings.py set:
       SECRET_KEY = os.getenv('SECRET_KEY')
   
       DEBUG = os.getenv("DEBUG") == "True"
   
   In manage.py folder create .env file.
   
   Add to .env file variables used in settings.py config: 
       SECRET_KEY = example_name
       DEBUG = True
   ```
